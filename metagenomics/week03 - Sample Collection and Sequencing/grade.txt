Your script was easy to follow but the numbers you posted were for the wrong sample (the assignment said for SRS012902.  I ran the solution on your SRS012291 singleton instead and found your numbers off.  They should have been:
 
Input file format: FASTAQ
Total sequences found: 138391
Total residues found : 10493589
 
I have posted a solution for you to look over and/or use here:
