This was a good review, though your first sentence was a bit truncated.  You've piqued my curiosity here, and I'm wondering about the sampling.  If you're interested in investigating a change in microflora in response to permafrost thawing, do any of the specific sites linked have longitudinal sample data available?  That isn't made clear in your example.
 
Overall, nicely done, and I'm glad to see you have your data collected together.
 
I also noticed an empty file in your refgenomes directory called 'help'.  Is this a plea?
