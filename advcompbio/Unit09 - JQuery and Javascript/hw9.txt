Unit 9 Homework – Javascript and jQuery
1. (4 points) For any small Javascript task, give the syntax for doing it normally and then give an 
example of how jQuery makes that task easier to code. (Can just be one or two lines of code 
each)

//Javascript
function myFunction()
{
var obj=document.getElementById("h01");
obj.innerHTML="Hello jQuery";
}
onload=myFunction;

//JQuery
function myFunction()
{
$("#h01").html("Hello jQuery");
}
$(document).ready(myFunction);


2. (4 points) What is the difference in Javascript between declaring a variable that will 
hold an integer and a variable that will hold a string?

Numbers do not require quotes whereas strings do.

3. (4 points) Provide the single line of code that would be required to pop up an alert to 
the user and make the contents of the alert the 4th element of an array called 'warnings'

window.alert(warnings[3]);

4. (4 points) Show the jQuery selector syntax that would select all elements on the page of 
class 'warnings' and make them hidden.

$(".warnings").hide();

5. (4 points) Show the jQuery syntax for saving the value of a form element with id 'codon' 
into a variable called 'codonVal'.

var codonVal = $('#codon').val();

6. ( 30 points ) 'Autocompletion' and 'type-ahead lookup' are common names for providing 
functionality so that a user can type in a form element and, as they type, suggested matching 
values to your query are displayed. This helps guide the user when they may not quite know 
the entire term or saves them time from typing it all out. You've probably noticed this using 
Google search and many other sites. It's something that's pretty easy to do (though scaling it 
well is a challenge with larger data.)
In the Unit 8 HW you modified our gene search program to read out of a database instead of 
parsing through the Genbank file, displaying the results in a table. In the lectures from this 
week I modified that code to show how to perform that search as an AJAX call that returned 
and parsed JSON formatted results and display them on the browser. That code can be found 
on the server here:
/var/www/jorvis/unit09
Make a copy of that directory into your web area. Read the jQuery documentation on the 
'autocomplete' function here:
http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/Then modify the unit09 code I provided to add auto-complete functionality to the search box. 
Limit the number of rows returned to 5 so that large lists aren't returned. As always, use 
internet searches, the forums, office hours and e-mail if you run into any problems.
