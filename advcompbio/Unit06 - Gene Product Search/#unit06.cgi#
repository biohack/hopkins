=head1 DESCRIPTION

From Unit 05, homework question #1:

In the homework from Unit 3 you wrote scripts to parse a FASTA file and gather
some size statistics on the sequences found within it. For this assignment, make a copy of that
script and modify it to present the same summary as a CGI page instead. This will mean that
you'll need to create a template file your script will populate using HTML::Template. You
should store your code in your user directory under /var/www and follow the directory
conventions from the lecture.

Your template should have the summary information at the top of the page, and then underneath
it I want you to add a table that contains three columns. In the first put the ID of each sequence
from the file, put the length in the second, and molar mass in the third.

NOTE: I've modified the core of the script some since lesson 3, since you know subroutine now.
