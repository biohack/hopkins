Unit 6 Homework – CGI and HTML forms
1. In HTML, how do you direct the browser to the script that will process your form?

the action attribute of <form> element
ex: <form action='./search_products.cgi'>

2. If you have a series of check boxes in your form that all have the same value for the “name”
attribute, how would you store them into a variable within your perl CGI script?
	<input type='checkbox' name='molecule' value='dna'>DNA
	<input type='checkbox' name='molecule' value='rna'>RNA
	<input type='checkbox' name='molecule' value='trna'>tRNA

You would store the values in an array.


3. What happens if you use an element type such as 'date' and it's not supported by the browser?

You cannot utilize the element. For example, with 'date': in Chrome, a supported browser, I can change the date from the default date, whereas in IE and Firefox, both unsupported browsers (or status unknown), I get a server error when I try to change the date. 

4. Read the documentation for the CGI module and write the code you'd need if you wanted to
record the IP address of the person submitting your form into a variable. (google, or enter
'perldoc CGI' on the terminal.)

use $ENV{REMOTE_ADDR}

use CGI; 
print "Content-type: text/plain\n";
my $q = new CGI;
print $q->remote_host(); ## print the user ip address


The following exercise should be performed on the class server and will be checked once
the assignment is due. 

5. ( 12 points ) Make a copy of the following file and place it within your web directory:
/home/jorvis/e_coli_k12_dh10b.gbk
This is the entire annotated genome of E. coli K12. Create an page called 'search.html' in your
web area that contains a valid HTML5 page and a single search box, where users can enter a
gene product name they wish to search for. Make your form submit to a script you create called
'search_product.cgi'. This script should read through that gbk file looking for any “/product”
tags that contain the exact search string, and use a template you create called
'search_product.tmpl' to display the results. The results should show not only the matched
product names but their corresponding locus_tag entries as well. So if I searched for 'glutamate
synthase' I'd expect to get an HTML page that contains a data table that looks like this:
